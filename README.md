# Matrix computations

Here I gathered some implementations for matrix computations. There are a few basic operations, such as multiplication by vector and matrix, matrix transpose, simple solvers for triangular linear systems and cholesky's decomposition.

The implementation needs some improvements (I also used this as an excuse for C++ coding training), and in the future more functions will be incorporated in this repo.

All the algorithms contained here are based on the book Fundamentals of Matrix Computations, Second Edition, by David S. Watkins.
